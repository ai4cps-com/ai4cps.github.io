### Artificial Intelligence for Cyber-Physical Systems

#### Production systems
The term cyber-physical production system (CPPS) refers to a network of actuators, sensors, controllers and other devices which intensively communicate in order to achieve physical production of goods.
The key enablers for the fast and wide spreading of this distributed design are advances in information technology, big data and communication technologies.
The doors got opened for the newest models and algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to be developed and applied, in order to achieve safer, more reliable and, in various ways, more efficient production.
The large potential and significance of this development can be seen in the political and economical decisions around the world, supposed to stimulate the ongoing 'fourth industrial revolution' (Industry 4.0).

### About the creator

Hello, my name is Nemanja Hranisavljevic and I am a currently a research associate at [Fraunhofer IOSB-INA](https://www.iosb-ina.fraunhofer.de/) in Lemgo and a PhD candidate at [HSU University](https://www.hsu-hh.de/imb/team) in Hamburg.
You can reach me on [nemanja.hran@gmail.com](mailto:nemanja.hran@gmail.com).

My research is focused on learning hybrid dynamical models from historical data in the domain of cyber-physical production systems.
The main studied idea is extraction of discrete automata models from complex data using deep neural networks as proposed in DENTA algorithm:
[Discretization of hybrid CPPS data into timed automaton using restricted Boltzmann machines (2020)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197620301986)

#### My GitHub repositories

Currently I am working on a framework for simulation/data generation and model learning of cyber-physical systems [time4cps](). It will be published in the next months.
