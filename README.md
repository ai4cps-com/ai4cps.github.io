## Welcome to my GitHub Page
Hello, my name is Nemanja Hranisavljevic and I am a research assistent at Fraunhofer IOSB-INA. 

My research is focused on learning hybrid behavioral models from historical data in the domain of cyber-physical production systems. The main studied idea is discretization of continuous behavior using deep neural networks as proposed in DENTA algorithm:
