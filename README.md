## Welcome to Nemanja's GitHub Page
Hello, my name is Nemanja Hranisavljevic and I am a research associate at [Fraunhofer IOSB-INA](https://www.iosb-ina.fraunhofer.de/). 
You can reach me on [nemanja.hranisavljevic@iosb-ina.fraunhofer.de](mailto:nemanja.hranisavljevic@iosb-ina.fraunhofer.de).

My research is focused on learning hybrid behavioral models from historical data in the domain of cyber-physical production systems. The main studied idea is discretization of continuous behavior using deep neural networks as proposed in DENTA algorithm: 
[Discretization of hybrid CPPS data into timed automaton using restricted Boltzmann machines (2020)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197620301986)


Currently I am working on a framework for simulation/data generation and model learning of cyber-physical systems [time4cps](). It will be published in the next months.


### My portfolio:

- [2008-2013] Studied Computer Sciences and Automation at [Faculty of Technical Sciences](http://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/), University of Novi Sad, Serbia.
  - Finished Master Degree in the field of Automation and Control Engineering with the best student award
- [2013-2015] Worked at the Faculty of Technical Sciences as an Assistent of a Professor on multiple courses including "Modeling and Simulation"
  - Worked on projects for [Schneider Electric DMS NS](www.schneider-electric-dms.com) from Novi Sad in the data integration group responsible for integration of customer information models of electrical grids into the extended CIM industrial standard. 
- [2016-2018] PhD candidate at the Insitute Industrial IT [inIT](www.init-owl.de) in Lemgo, Germany
- [2018-2023] Reseach Associate at [Fraunhofer IOSB-INA](https://www.iosb-ina.fraunhofer.de/) in Lemgo
  - In parallel a PhD candidate at [Helmut Schmidt University](https://www.hsu-hh.de/imb/team) in Hamburg
